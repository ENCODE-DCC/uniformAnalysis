# ENCODE 3 pipeline/galaxy settings file: for defining important locations and settings
encodeSettingsVersion 1.0

# Setting with File and Dir suffixes:
# suffix 'File' is a full path to a resource file of some kind
#               Example: 'chromInfoFile' is the full path to the chromInfo file
# suffix 'Dir' is a ful path to a directory, expected to end in '/'
#               Example: toolsDir is the default tool bin directory
 
# Location outside of galaxy to put important results.  If results are needed inside galaxy
# for further steps, they will be symlinked into galaxy.
# NOTE: Only needed or used if input files are located inside galaxy database.
#       Input files from symlinked library will be considered outside of galaxy.
# must end in '/'. or be undeclared
#resultsDir /hive/users/tdreszer/galaxy/out/

# Location outside of galaxy to put temporary, intermediate results
# NOTE: files written to tmpDir are considered expendable as soon as the step that writes thm ends.
# must end in '/'. Undeclared means temp files are written into galaxy execution directory
tmpDir	/hive/users/tdreszer/galaxy/tmp/

# Default location of tools.  If full {exe}Tool path not defined then the tool is looked for here
# If toolBinPath is not defined then all tools without explicit paths defined are expected
# to be found in the environment PATH
# Replaced by $EAP_TOOLS_DIR
#toolsDir /hive/groups/encode/encode3/tools/

# tools database RA file (for version look-up).
# Replaced by $EAP_TOOLS_DIR/tools.ra
#toolDbFile /hive/groups/encode/encode3/tools/tools.ra

# Default location of reference files.  
# Beneath this the dir structure should be as: 
# [gender.]{genome}/chrom.sizes           (e.g. female.hg19/chrom.sizes)
# {genome}/[{gender}.]{genome}.[2bit|fa]  (e.g. hg19/female.hg19.2bit)
# [gender.]{genome}/{tool}Data/*          (e.g. hg19/bwaData/hg19.fa.bwt)
# Replaced by $EAP_REF_DIR
#refDir /hive/groups/encode/encode3/encValData/

# Location of chromosome information for different reference genomes.
