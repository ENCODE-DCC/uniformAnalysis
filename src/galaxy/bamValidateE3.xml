.. class:: infomark

   Evaluates a sampling of a bam alignments file.  
   An *ENCODE3 analysis* involves multiple steps and dataset replicates, of which this is one.
   Use *ENCODE3 workflows* to ensure that all analysis steps are performed in the proper sequence.

**Inputs:**
    The **Alignments file** is expected to be the generated output from a previous 
    *ENCODE3 fastQ alignment* step.  

    In order to properly evaluate an alignment, it is important to specifiy 
    whether it was generated from **Single or Paired reads**.

    The **Replicate** number allows combining multiple replicates into a single analysis.  If the 
    replicate number is not incremented then repeated steps will overwrite previous replicate 
    results.  Merged replicates should have a 0 (zero) replicate number. 

    The optional **Analysis Name** field will be used to tie multiple steps together into 
    one analysis, ensuring related files are well named and a single log records all processing 
    taken.  If the intention is to run multiple analyses, then providing an analysis name ensures 
    that results from one analyis are over-written by another.  Multiple histories for a single user 
    can share the same named analysis, but two separate users cannot.

**Outputs:**
    This step is expected to produce three files:
    
    - **bam sample** is a randomized sample of the bam alignments file that will be evaluated.  
      It will also be input for later processing in the ENCODE 3 pipeline.
    - **Histogram metrics** produced by the 'census' package.
    - **Strand-Correlation** produced by the 'phantom-tools' package.
    
    The **log** of this single step can be seen under *view details* stdout.
    
    If the outputs are delivered to a location external to galaxy, the **Analysis log** covering 
    all steps of the analysis will be delivered to the same location.  Otherwise the log may be
    found in the directory pointed to by 'tmpDir' as defined in the settings file.

||encPng||All *ENCODE3 Analysis* steps provided through Galaxy are run via the same python    | 
|        |scripts and third-party tools as the official *ENCODE3 Analysis Pipeline*.  Just as | 
|        |with the official pipeline, all work is be performed in temporary directories and   |
|        |successful results moved to well-named locations.  If the initial input datasets are| 
|        |from a symlinked Galaxy library, results will be moved to the same directory as the |  
|        |inputs and then symlinked back into Galaxy. If the initial inputs do not have a     | 
|        |recognizable location outside the Galaxy database, then results will be written     |
|        |back into the Galaxy database as well.                                              |
