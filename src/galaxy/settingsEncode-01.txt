# Setting with File and Dir suffixes:
# suffix 'File' is a full path to a resource file of some kind
#               Example: 'chromInfoFile' is the full path to the chromInfo file
# suffix 'Dir' is a ful path to a directory, expected to end in '/'
#               Example: toolsDir is the default tool bin directory
