# ENCODE 3 pipeline/galaxy settings file: for defining important locations and settings
encodeSettingsVersion 1.0

# Setting with Tool, File and Dir suffixes:
# suffix 'Tool' is a full path to an executable (or script or jar)  The prefix is the executable:
#               Example: 'bwaTool' is the full path to the 'bwa' executable.
# suffix 'File' is a full path to a resource file of some kind
#               Example: 'chromInfoFile' is the full path to the chromInfo file
# suffix 'Dir' is a ful path to a directory, expected to end in '/'
#               Example: toolsDir is the default tool bin directory
 
# Location outside of galaxy to put important results.  If results are needed inside galaxy
# for further steps, they will be symlinked into galaxy.
# NOTE: Only needed or used if input files are located inside galaxy database.
#       Input files from symlinked library will be considered outside of galaxy.
# must end in '/'. or be undeclared
resultsDir /hive/users/tdreszer/galaxy/out/

# Location outside of galaxy to put temporary, intermediate results
# NOTE: files written to tmpDir are considered expendable as soon as the step that writes thm ends.
# must end in '/'. Undeclared means temp files are written into galaxy execution directory
tmpDir	/hive/users/tdreszer/galaxy/tmp/

# Default location of tools.  If full {exe}Tool path not defined then the tool is looked for here
# If toolBinPath is not defined then all tools without explicit paths defined are expected
# to be found in the environment PATH
toolsDir /cluster/home/mmaddren/grad/pipeline/

# Location of assembly file for alignments
dbAssemblyFile /cluster/home/mmaddren/grad/pipeline/data/hg19/hg19.fa

# Location of chromosome information for current DB
chromInfoFile /cluster/home/mmaddren/grad/pipeline/gcap/GCAP-master/gcap/chromInfo_hg19.txt


# Standard and tool specific locations.
# Note: If single executable for tool then path should be full path to executable, 
        keyed on executable name+'Tool' (e.g. bwa exec is keyed on 'bwaPath' 
# If tool contains several executables, then {tool}Dir is to directory containing all executables.
# NOTE: if toolsDir is declared, it is the default path for all tools.  
#       (e.g. if bwaTool not found then {toolsDir}bwa is expected to exist.
